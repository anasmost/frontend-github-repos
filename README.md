## Description

      It is a simple react App that fetches most starred github repos
    pushed to Github in the last 30 days.
      It lets the user scroll indefinitely as long as the Github API
    doesn't reject requests. This could happen due an excceeded request limit.

## Set Up Development Environment

**`npm install`**  
**`npm run start`**

## Build Production Files

**`npm run build`**  
They're written in `build/` folder
